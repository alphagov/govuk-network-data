You’ll want to loop through this list and add this information to our graph. There are a couple ways to do this, but NetworkX provides two convenient functions for adding attributes to all of a Graph’s nodes or edges at once: `nx.set_node_attributes()` and `nx.set_edge_attributes()`. To use these functions, you’ll need your attribute data to be in the form of a Python dictionary, in which node names are the keys and the attributes you want to add are the values. You’ll want to create a dictionary for each one of your attributes, and then add them using the functions above. The first thing you must do is create five empty dictionaries, using curly braces:"

These edges currently don’t have directions (that is, we're assuming a symmetric relationship between pages; this is wrong, users move from one page to another but might not necessarily go back again) nor do they include additional information (we actually have weights for them which are the occurrences of users moving between these pages).

Too few nodes (say, 15), and a network analysis is less useful than drawing a picture or doing some reading; too many (say, 15 million), and you should consider starting with a subset or finding a supercomputer. Ours appears to be just right, where we can leverage network analysis to make better use of the data.

For example, you can determine what communities pages find themselves in, but you can’t determine the directional routes through which information might flow along the network (you’d need a directed network for that; which we'll look to implement in another notebook). By using the symmetric, undirected relationships in this case, you’ll be able to find sub-communities and the pages who are important to those communities, a process that would be more difficult (though still possible) with a directed network.

    "There are lots of ways to visualize a network, and a force-directed layout, of which the above image is an example, is among the most common. Force-directed graphs attempt to find the optimum placement for nodes with a calculation based on the tension of springs in Hooke’s Law, which for smaller graphs often creates clean, easy-to-read visualizations. The visualization embedded above shows you there is a single large component of connected nodes (in the center) and several small components with just one or two connections around the edges (this is to be expected as our page list is mainly for demo purposes; there's some user searches for brexit that are picked up). This is a fairly common network structure. Knowing that there are multiple components in the network will usefully limit the calculations you’ll want to perform on it. By displaying the number of connections (known as degree, see below) as the size of nodes, the visualization also shows that there are a few nodes with lots of connections that keep the central component tied together (although there's not any obvious hubs here). These large nodes are known as hubs, and the fact that they show up so clearly here gives you a clue as to what you’ll find when you measure centrality in the next section.\n",

Similarly, in triadic closure, if person A knows page B and page B knows page C, then page A probably knows page C: hence, transitivity.). Transitivity is the ratio of all triangles over all possible triangles. A possible triangle exists when one page (C) knows two pages (A and B). So transitivity, like density, expresses how interconnected a graph is in terms of a ratio of actual over possible connections. Remember, measurements like transitivity and density concern likelihoods rather than certainties. All the outputs of your Python script must be interpreted, like any other object of research.

    "After getting some basic measures of the entire network structure, a good next step is to find which nodes are the most important ones in your network. In network analysis, measures of the importance of nodes are referred to as centrality measures.

Here you’ll learn about three of the most common centrality measures: degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.\n",

Since each of those edges will always have a node on the other end, you might think of degree as the number of pages to which a given page is directly connected. The nodes with the highest degree in a social network are the pages who know the most pages. These nodes are often referred to as hubs, and calculating degree is the quickest way of identifying hubs.\n",

Degree can tell you about the biggest hubs, but it can’t tell you that much about the rest of the nodes. And in many cases, those hubs it’s telling you about are not especially surprising. In this case almost all of the hubs are mainstream content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully there are other centrality measures that can tell you about more than just hubs. Eigenvector centrality is a kind of extension of degree—it looks at a combination of a node’s edges and the edges of that node’s neighbors. Eigenvector centrality cares if you are a hub, but it also cares how many hubs you are connected to. It’s calculated as a value from 0 to 1: the closer to one, the greater the centrality. Eigenvector centrality is useful for understanding which nodes can get information to many other nodes quickly. If you know a lot of well-connected pages, you could spread a message very efficiently. If you’ve used Google, then you’re already somewhat familiar with Eigenvector centrality. Their PageRank algorithm uses an extension of this formula to decide which webpages get to the top of its search results. We can use this metric on our subgraph to identify pages with lots of well-connected neighbours.\n",

To do this, it must first calculate every possible shortest path in your network, so keep in mind that betweenness centrality will take longer to calculate than other centrality measures (but it won’t be an issue in a dataset of this size). Betweenness centrality, which is also expressed on a scale of 0 to 1, is fairly good at finding nodes that connect two otherwise disparate parts of a network. If you’re the only thing connecting two clusters, every communication between those clusters has to pass through you. In contrast to a hub, this sort of node is often referred to as a broker. Betweenness centrality is not the only way of finding brokerage (and other methods are more systematic), but it’s a quick way of giving you a sense of which nodes are important not because they have lots of connections themselves but because they stand between groups, giving the network connectivity and cohesion.\n",

    "Another common thing to ask about a network dataset is what the subgroups or communities are within the larger social structure. Is your network one big, happy family where everyone knows everyone else? Or is it a collection of smaller subgroups that are only connected by one or two intermediaries? The field of community detection in networks is designed to answer these questions. There are many ways of calculating communities, cliques, and clusters in your network, but the most popular method currently is modularity. Modularity is a measure of relative density in your network: a community (called a module or modularity class) has high density relative to other nodes within its module but low density with those outside. Modularity gives you an overall score of how fractious your network is, and that score can be used to partition the network and return the individual communities.13\n",

There aren’t nearly as many actual connections as possible connections, and there are several altogether disconnected components. Its worthwhile partitioning this sparse network with modularity and seeing if the result make historical and analytical sense.\n",

Modularity will find these components and treat them as separate classes (since they’re not connected to anything else).

Frequently at Six Degrees of Francis Bacon, we export NetworkX data in D3’s specialized JSON format, for visualization in the browser. You could even export your graph as a Pandas dataframe if there were more advanced statistical operations you wanted to run. There are lots of options, and if you’ve been diligently adding all your metrics back into your Graph object as attributes, all your data will be exported in one fell swoop.\n",

    "In this tutorial we read in our node and edge csv.gz from our data pipeline. We created a graph object with the networkx and then calculated a variety of metrics that could be added as attributes of the nodes. Likewise we could use a similar approach for the edges if so inclined. We also used some pyviz modules to visualise the topology of a network. The could developed could be used to extend our data pipeline, so that users can create their own graphs of relevant pages (by inputing a page list as an arguemnt). This could run and compute the node attributes, outputting a graph for downstream applications."
