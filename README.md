> Data pipeline for extraction and preprocessing of BigQuery user journey data.

A data pipeline for extracting and preprocessing BigQuery user journey data. The data captures the sequences of pages visited by users and how often these journies occur. Additional metadata and Event data (what users do on their journey) is also provided.  

# Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

This should probably include setting up the computing environment and the necessary permissions required. Who to ask for them or point to a wiki page. 

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

# Initial configuration

## Python version
Python 3.6.0

## Virtual environment

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Where to put your BigQuery key

`mkdir key`

then put the json file in there

# Features

This package arms data scientists with the tools to answer the hardest questions that people are asking about the sequence of pages that users are visiting and the type of behaviour those users are displaying.  

* A data pipeline that produces data in a convenient format to explore the GOV.UK page sequences or journies that users travel in a session.   
* Express this data as a graph with pages visited expressed as nodes and directed movement between pages as edges.   

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.


## Running a big query extract

`python src/data/bq_extract_data.py '2018-10-15' '2018-10-15' 'test_dir' 'test' 'simple_test.sql'`

## Creating a csv with each row a user journey with sessions rolled into it

For example is 3 users went A -> B -> C on different devices, then this would be a single row with each device listed in that column

# Developing

```shell

git clone https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govuk-network-data
cd govuk-network-data/

```

## Unit tests
pytest is used for unit testing. Install using pip: 

`pip install -U pytest`

Following installation navigate to the appropriate folder to run tests. For example to run tests on functions associated with the data extraction pipeline, go to `./src/data/` and run:  

`python -m pytest -v tests/`  
or
`python3 -m pytest -v tests/`
